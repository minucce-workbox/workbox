World objects are drawn on top of the bottom HUD
-  Should be rendered behind it or invisible



When dashboard line is reached
*  Turn off OBJ layer
*  Upload new OAM data
*  Turn on OBJ layer



Because we start in h-blank, run priority items first

Road flickers when too many sprites are on same line
-  Not enough h-blank + oam-blank time to write ppu
   Usually it's color register that goes bad



HUD line check is done after ppu writes
*  When scanline reached, manually wait for next h-blank instead of relying on irq
