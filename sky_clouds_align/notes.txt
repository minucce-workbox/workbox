Cloud tiles often use wrong texture line during rendering.
-  Lots of data is computed before scanline starts drawing.
   Often goes past h-blank period and corrupts pixels.



Reduce amount of math needed to draw each line.
-  Pre-write static PPU values.
-  Faster table lookup for scroll values.
-  Wait h-blank to avoid PPU misfires.  (flashing dots)
