Cloud tiles often use wrong texture line during rendering
-  Lots of data is computed before scanline starts drawing
   Often goes past h-blank period and corrupts pixels



Reduce amount of math needed to draw each line
-  Do scroll table lookup in V-Blank
-  Pre-write static PPU values in V-Blank

-  Cache scroll values before H-Blank
-  Wait h-blank to avoid PPU misfires  (flashing dots)

-  ASM optimize

Release 19.1


Unusual glitch occurs when vblank triggers as cloud scroll tables are being generated
-  Creates a texture misalignment with scroll-x  (dirty $CB40 values)



Requires buffering technique
-  cb00 --> cb20 = scy table
-  cb40 --> cb30 = scx table  (* new)


1. When cloud positions are done, $CFA6 is set
2. $0F41 memcpy work buffer to draw buffer
3. Sky renderer uses $CB30 data and glitch is gone
