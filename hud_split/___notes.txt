Border hud on world map likes to flicker a lot
-  Scroll and nametable are swapped out during active draw



After scanline 0, pre-buffer writes
-  Scroll (6-5-x-x) + nametable (-xxxx)


After sprite 0, finish during h-blank
-  Scroll (x-x-5-6) + nametable (x----)

Use OAM $2004 to wait for pre-scanline
-  Wait 1 scanline for active draw
-  Then safe to cache 6-5 scroll data
