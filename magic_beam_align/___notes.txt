When firing magic beams, it aligns with the player position and not the weapon's coordinate
-  Looks kinda strange at large zoom factors  (4x)


Magic beams are manually moved based on orientation


Vertical down sword is also h-flipped to match player hand and center the blade
-  Displaced Gamers mentioned that sword sprite center was off-by-1 to right
