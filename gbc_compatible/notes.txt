Game relies on strange IRQ behavior with DMG models.
*  When STAT register is written during VBlank, it always triggers immediate IRQ.
*  GB Color models do not have this hardware bug and won't load in-game.


Simulate this interrupt by manually raising IF (02) LCD flag.



Thanks to GB Development community for explaining why game crashes on emulators.
